  <h3>Always welcome at any gathering</h3>
  Homemade potato chips are fun and easy. Guaranteed they won't last long! A food processor with a slicing
  attachment
  is very helpful for slicing the potatoes. Experiment with the thickness; you may like them thicker or thinner. I
  like to use olive oil for frying, but you can use safflower, corn, or peanut oil as well as vegetable oil.</p>

    <li>Drain slices and rinse under cold water. Refill the bowl with water, add 3 tablespoons salt, and put slices
      back in the bowl. Let potatoes soak in the salty water for at least 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Drain and rinse slices again. Pat dry.</li>
