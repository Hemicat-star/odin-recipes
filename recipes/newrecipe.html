<p>This recipe, while based on the traditionally recipe, doesn't deep fry the pork. Instead we will braise the 
    pork in a dutch oven with seasonings with juice and liquid. After the pork is finished in the oven a reduction method
    is used for the leftover braising liquid and the pork is finished off under the broiler.</p>
