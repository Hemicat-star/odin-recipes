      <dt><h3>What are carnitas?</h3></dt>
      <dd>Carnitas literal meaning is "little meats" and is made from pork.</dd>
      <dd>Carnitas are a variation of pulled pork originated from Michoacan, Mexico.</dd>
      <dd>Carnitas traditionally use heavily marbled, rich cuts of either Boston butt or picnic ham.</dd>
      <dd>The pork is cut into small chunks, seasoned, and either braised or deep fried.</dd>
      <dd>Lard or oil in a copper pot is considered the traditional way of cooking</dd>
      <dd>The meat is considered done when it can be pulled apart with ease by hand or fork.</dd>
      </dt>

    </dl>
<p>This recipe, while based on the traditionally recipe, doesn't deep fry the pork. Instead we will braise the 
    pork in a dutch oven with seasonings with juice and liquid. After the pork is finished in the oven a reduction method
    is used for the leftover braising liquid and the pork is finished off under the broiler.</p>
