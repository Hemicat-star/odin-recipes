## Website practice ##

------------------

  In this project, I'll be following The Odin Project's instructions to build a
  foundational website. I'll be using HTML tags to create clickable links,
  headings, images, and be using git to keep everything up to date and
  palatable.

  As part of the practice project, I will be writing and committing messages to
  the project in order to more about the git commit -m command. I will be
  updating the README.md as I follow along with the instructions I receive. 

  I am also learning about markdown syntax during this **practice** because of
  the strong sentiment towards having good commit messages.
